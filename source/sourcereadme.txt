First we are welcomed by a login/registration page where user can login using their registered username and password or can register themselves
to authorise their login credentials. 
Once authenticated the user is shown the list of all available items with the picture of the category
the products fall in. The user can also search for an item they desire to get in the searchbar located at the top of the screen. The user has
the facility to refresh the list to update the items available.
 Once the user has made his/her mind to take an item, he/she can claim an item by
clicking on the item from the list, looking at the details and clicking the claim button. 
Once done the item is removed from the list so that the user can use that time to contact the donor and get the item.
